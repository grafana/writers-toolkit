# Topic types

The Grafana Labs documentation is made up of different topic types. The main types are concepts, tasks, and references. We encouage you to use these basic topic types when you write content.

Depending on the needs of a particular product area, select a topic type from the following table to learn about each.

Type | Description
---|---
[Concept]({{< relref "/concept-topics/" >}}) | Provides an overview and background information. Answers the question "What is it?".
[Task]({{< relref "/task-topics/" >}}) | Provides numbered steps that describe how to achieve an outcome. Answers the question "How do I?".
[Reference]({{< relref "/reference-topics/" >}}) | Provides users with the information they might need to refer to during a task. Answers the question "What details do I need to accomplish this task?".
[Tutorial]({{< relref "/tutorial-topics/" >}}) |  Add description...

For your convenience, we have created topic templates. Please refer to [Templates](https://github.com/grafana/writers-toolkit/tree/main/docs/static/templates) for more information.
