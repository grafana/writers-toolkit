# Topic types

Grafana Labs documentation uses different topic types: _concept_, _task_, _reference_, and _tutorial_.
When you write content, you should use one of these topic types.

Depending on the needs of a particular product area, select a topic type from the following table to learn about each.

<!-- vale Grafana.GoogleFirstPerson = NO -->

**[Concept](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/structure/topic-types/concept/)**
: Provides an overview and background information. Answers the question "What is it?".

**[Task]({{< relref "./task" >}})**
: Provides numbered steps that describe how to achieve an outcome. Answers the question "How do I?".

**[Reference]({{< relref "./reference" >}})**
: Provides users with the information they might need to refer to during a task. Answers the question "What details do I need to accomplish this task?".

**[Tutorial]({{< relref "./tutorial" >}})**
: Provides procedures that users can safely reproduce and learn from. Answers the question: "Can you teach me to …?"

<!-- vale Grafana.GoogleFirstPerson = YES -->

For your convenience, there are topic [templates](https://github.com/grafana/writers-toolkit/tree/main/docs/static/templates).

## Templates for standardized topics

In addition to the primary topic types, there are also templates for specific topic types to ensure that pages documenting the same subject matter have a standard format.

These [templates](https://github.com/grafana/writers-toolkit/tree/main/docs/static/templates) are in the same directory as the topic type templates.

| Type                                              | Description                                                                          |
