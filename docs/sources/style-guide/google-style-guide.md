# Google style guide

The Grafana Technical Writing team has adopted the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) as the source for Grafana technical content styles and standards. When you have a question about writing and formatting content, refer to the Google style guide.

The remainder of this guide highlights important guidelines already addressed in the Google style guide (yes, they are _that_ important) and guidelines that are Grafana-specific.
