# Voice and tone guidelines

At Grafana, we like our company to sound like a real person. Specifically, a real person who isn’t trying to sell you something. 

Voice and tone reflect your attitude and how you convey information. Your voice is who the reader hears talking as they read documentation. Voice comes across in word choice and how you use **bold**, *italics**, punctuation, and grammar. Tone reflects the urgency of your message and can changed based on the situation.

Consult the following voice and tone guidelines when you write technical documentation.

### Be confident

Write in a confident, authoritative tone to instill confidence in the reader. You know this
information better than anyone, so let your style reflect your expertise.

### Be conversational 

Write in a natural and conversational style with language that reflects a tone that is positive and friendly. Use simple, concise, and easy to understand words and sentences that are informative and helpful. 

### Formal tone versus casual tone 

Compared to traditional business writing, a more casual tone in UI copy and supporting material is increasingly accepted.  

You can start sentences with the words ‘and’, ‘but’, and ‘so’ in moderation and when it allows for shorter sentences. 

### Everyday tasks and activities 

When the user completes everyday tasks and activities, write in a way that the user knows what a feature is or that something has happened as expected. The goal is to give the user just enough information to complete a task without overemphasizing ourselves or the product. 

| Do  | Don't |
|---|---|
| Look for the simplest way to communicate information—words aren’t always necessary. | Use overly complicated or intimidating language. |

### Learning 

Sometimes it helps to give more explanation or education. In these situations, we want to make sure people feel confident in their actions and in Grafana capabilities. 

| Do  | Don't |
|---|---|
| Help people understand why they should do something, not just how. | Oversell or overpromise. |

### Motivate or encourage action 

Write in a way that provides the user clarity and context about next steps so that they are motivated to continue down a desired path. 

| Do  | Don't |
|---|---|
| Help people understand what the next steps are and why they should take them. | Assume that the user knows what the next steps are or what the outcome will be. |
