# Contribute to What's New or release notes

This topic explains the decisions and actions associated with collecting, writing, and publishing What's New content.

> **Note:** This topic is only relevant for internal Grafana Labs contributors.

## What's New doc development process

Developing directly in Markdown reduces errors and removes a manual (toilsome and error-prone step), by creating, editing, discussing, and publishing in the same format from which we will publish in GitHub, using the Grafana repo.

Consider adding an image, though be aware that we will not maintain them, as the document reflects a "point in time." If you need to add an image, refer to [Image, diagram, and screenshot guidelines]({{< relref "../image-guidelines" >}}).

### When the prior release is complete

Complete the following steps within one week after the prior release goes out.

1. The Docs Squad identifies the technical writer responsible for overseeing the What’s New content development process for the upcoming release.
1. The identified technical writer cuts a branch and creates a draft PR with an empty What's New doc to be populated with the What’s New content for the next release, along with the updated What's New index page.
   - This PR should include an update to the link and version number located on the What's New tile of `docs/sources/_index.md`.
   - This PR should include the new Upgrade Guide page (process TBA).
   - This PR should not have a `backport` label initially.
1. The technical writer then pins a link to the [version-number-release-gtm](https://raintank-corp.slack.com/archives/C02L8GQJGBW) Slack channel.

   > **Note:** A Product Manager (PM) is responsible for updating the version number of that channel after a release goes out.

1. The technical writer posts in the Slack channel that the What's New PR is ready for contributions.
1. The PM or PMM on point communicates with engineering squads without a PM resource about who’s on point for What’s New PR reviews from within the PM and PMM orgs.

   Refer to [Grafana Releases and Release Dates](https://grafana-intranet--simpplr.visualforce.com/apex/simpplr__app?u=/site/a145f000001dCXBAA2/page/a125f000001AXrwAAG) for a list of release dates and go-to-market coordinators.

### Throughout a release

A Grafana release cycle is typically 6-8 weeks, and during that time, developers are empowered to add to the What's New document incrementally. To see a list of release dates and assigned PMs and PMMs, refer to [Grafana Releases and Release Dates](https://grafana-intranet--simpplr.visualforce.com/apex/simpplr__app?u=/site/a145f000001dCXBAA2/page/a125f000001AXrwAAG).

Complete the following steps throughout a release cycle:

1. Dev teams add commits directly against the branch.

   > **Note:** As an alternative, Dev teams can cut PRs against the branch, add What’s New content, collaborate with reviewers, and merge the PR into the What's New branch.

1. The technical writer periodically checks the What's New PR to determine how much content has been added.

At this point, the larger Marketing org can review the What’s New content in the branch.

### At the end of a release

Complete the following steps in the days leading up to the release:

1. Five days before the GA release:

   - The PM or PMM running the release sends a **Last Call** to dev teams to get in their What’s New content.
   - The technical writer changes the PR status from **Draft** to **Ready for Review**.

1. Two days before the release, What’s New content is frozen.

1. A PM reviews all content and adjusts wording, where appropriate.

1. The technical writer provides a copy edit.

1. The technical writer coordinates with Release Management and the GTM team for precise timing of when to merge the What's New doc into main.

1. On release day, the technical writer merges the What’s New branch into main and backports the doc to the feature version branch.

## How to determine if content belongs in a What's New document

Grafana publishes a What’s New [docs page](/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/) and [blog post](/blog/2022/11/29/grafana-9.3-release/) along with every minor and major release. These posts are popular, and a good way for users to learn about the exciting new things we’ve released. What’s New also drives our go-to-market enablement: we train the field and make videos on the topics in What’s New.

However, unlike our comprehensive changelog, What’s New is curated. If it contained every update, it would be too noisy for people to read, and if we wrote a detailed What’s New post for every little bug fix, we’d be wasting our time.

So how do you decide whether to write a What’s New post for your latest improvement?

### Add a What’s New for anything that could make a customer say “oo! 😃 ” or “ooo… 😬 ”

What's new content should address changes that have some kind of material impact on the user experience.

- Include changes that _affect customers_, whether they are new features to try out or important, long-requested bug fixes.
  - Most visualization changes and most additions to the UI should be in the What's new document, even when they seem small.
- Almost every change or addition associated with Prometheus and Loki is of interest, too.
- What's New content should also include changes that require customers to do something, like change their API keys to Service Accounts, or stop using a deprecated API or plugin.
- A What's New doc should include announcements—things we want customers to notice and try out. These could also be notable community contributions where we want to thank a contributor.

When in doubt, ask your nearest PM or EM. Err on the side of _yes, put it in What’s New_.

### Examples of what to include in What’s New

- A new Transformation: [Partition by values](/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v9-3/#new-transformation-partition-by-values).
  - This is one of many transformations, but it is brand-new functionality that a user might not notice if they didn’t read the What's New document. What’s New is also a low-effort place to describe some nice use cases and examples for the feature so that users adopt it.
- The new [Candlestick visualization](/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v8-3/#candlestick-panel-beta).
  - This was a beta feature, but still listed in What’s new in order to get the word out and encourage users to try it.
- All-new Swagger docs for the API.
  - This is significant because it makes our documentation much easier to use, and it’s a new place for users to go for help when using our API.
- [Removing beta labels from several panels](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/58557), which makes then generally available.
  - This is a small change code-wise, but a big statement with big customer impact. Customers now know that those plugins are fully supported and recommended for use in production.
- [New keyboard shortcut](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/61837)
  - This is a small change, but it brings attention to a feature that has been improved recently and that most people don't know about.
- [Search improvement for Flame graphs](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/61748)
  - Fuzzy search! Has to be in the blog post.
- [Changes to the Prometheus query editor](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/60718)
  - These are query patterns for the data source that most of our users use.

### Examples of what _not_ to include in What’s New

These are important improvements, but are better placed in the changelog than What’s new:

- [A docs update](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/60352)
  - This update doesn’t require customers to change their behavior—they’ll simply see better instructions the next time they use the docs.
- [A bug fix related to migrations](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/59438)
  - This is a bug fix that doesn’t require customer action.
- [A usability improvement to an existing transformation](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/59074)
  - Nice fix, but very detailed. Should be in the changelog but not What’s New.
- [Change regex to accommodate a new branching strategy in Enterprise](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/59429)
  - This change is invisible to customers.

## Writing guidelines for What's New content

Follow these guidelines to ensure that your What's New or release notes content is clear, helpful, and easy to understand.

- **Directly address your users.**

  Address them using the imperative or as “you”.

  **Example:**
  Shorten your communication time when reporting issues and requesting help from Grafana Labs by grabbing a panel’s query response data and panel settings.

- **Make use of active voice or present tense.**

  **Example:**
  Enable a configuration option to skip user organization and roles synchronization with your SAML provider.

- **Don't refer to the release version, for example, “In Grafana 9, we ” or “As of now, we”.**

  The What’s New or release notes are understood to be providing information for a specific release, so there is no need to repeat this information.

- **Provide high-level descriptions.**

  Tell customers what goal they can accomplish or what problems they can solve with the feature. Describe the business value. Don't go into details about how the feature works, or configuration steps.

  Link out to topics in the documentation that provide more detailed information or steps.

  **Example:**
  Use custom branding to make Grafana your observability tool by adding your own sign-in page, help links, logo, application name, and more.

  For more information, refer to [insert link to documentation].

- **Don't refer to how the feature used to work.**

  For example, don't say "Previously, alert rules changed state when the rule was facing an error or a timeout. Now, the state does not update."

- **For changes or updates to features, provide brief descriptions.**
