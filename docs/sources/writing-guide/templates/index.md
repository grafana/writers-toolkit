# Documentation templates

This section provides you with a collection of templates to help you write your documentation in the correct format, style, tone, and structure.
Choose from concept, task, or reference and get started quickly.

We donâ€™t distinguish between different types of content when we create new topics in Markdown. However, to ensure our documentation has a consistent look and feel for our users, please follow this clearly defined structure.

We write three core documentation types:

**Concept:** Describes how and why something works. Concepts answer the question "what is it?". When readers read concepts, they are learning about a topic. Use concepts to help the reader understand a technology, before they start using it.

[Path to template]

**Task:** Gives specific instructions about how to get something done to answer the question "how do I do <insert task>?". When readers read tasks, they are looking for action-oriented documentation to achieve a specific goal. This type of content will typically include numbered steps that the reader can follow to achieve that goal.

**Reference:** Contains structured information or specifications that users need to make a product work. Reference material answers the question "what else do I need to know?" When readers read references, they are fact-checking. Reference sections should comprehensively catalog data such as functions and their parameters, return codes, and error messages. They are often presented as tables, bulleted lists, or sample scripts.

Our templates follow these documentation types. Your information will naturally fit into these types as you write.
