# Writing guide

The writing guide defines the structured authoring environment we use to create documentation at Grafana Labs. Everyone who writes documentation for Grafana Labs should familiarize themselves and follow these guidelines.

The guidelines are for anyone who are interested in improving Grafana Labs technical content. They are intended to guide you on your documentation journey, whether you are requesting a change, editing a topic, or writing a set of documentation for a new product or feature from scratch.
