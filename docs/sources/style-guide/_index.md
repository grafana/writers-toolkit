# Style guide

This style guide is a set of content guidelines that covers aspects of content style such as grammar, language, formatting, and tone; all the things needed to compose and present great content. It is intended for anyone who contributes to technical documentation at Grafana Labs.

It includes rules and best practices on the following:

- Capitalization and punctuation
- Terms to use and avoid
- Voice and tone
- Terminology
- Inclusive writing

When in doubt, defer to the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
