# About Grafana documentation

All Grafana Enterprise and OSS documentation is located in the Grafana open source project GitHub repository: https://github.com/grafana/grafana/tree/main/docs/sources.

The sources directory organizes content by topic areas into folders, for example, administration and alerting.

Each folder includes an _index.md file, which provides an overview of the topic, and optionally includes subtopics that provide more detail.
The _index.md file is required.

## Markdown
