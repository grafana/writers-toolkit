# Contribute to What's New or release notes

To help ensure the What’s New or release notes are helpful, relevant, and easy to read, follow these guidelines:

* Address users directly.

    Use the imperative or address them as “you”.
* Use active voice and present tense.

    Note: it is okay to use passive voice and past tense to describe changes that were made to the product.
* Do not write redundant statements about the release version, for example, “In Grafana 9, we ” or “As of now, we”.

  The What’s New or release notes are understood to be providing information for a specific release.
* Keep out marketing spins.

  Avoid terms like “fast” or “easy” - or trying to “sell” features.
* Include high-level descriptions.

  Start the descriptions with imperative statements that tell customers what goal they can accomplish or what problems they can solve with the feature. Describe the business value.
* For changes, provide brief descriptions.

* To provide more information on features and changes, cross-reference topics that provide more detailed information or steps.

## Examples:

**What’s New in the Grafana Coffee Shop**

**Americano**

Increase the user’s work ethic by injecting high levels of caffeine.

**Banesso**

Add extra nutritional value to the mix. This banana-coffee blend prevents users from feeling unhealthy while drinking coffee throughout the day.

**Mocha**

Increase the morale of your admin users. Incorporate a whimsical layer of chocolatey goodness.
