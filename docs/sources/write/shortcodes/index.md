# Shortcodes

Shortcodes are predefined templates used for rendering snippets in Hugo.

## Why use shortcodes?

Markdown is limited in its ability to render complex elements.
Although you might be tempted to insert HTML directly into content to make up for its limitations, you can instead use shortcodes to ensure consistency across the Grafana website.

The following sections describe shortcodes available for use in Grafana Markdown files. To learn about other shortcodes, refer to the Hugo [shortcode documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/).

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
The Grafana shortcode templates are defined in the `layouts/shortcodes` folder of the website repository which is only accessible to Grafana Labs employees.
To request custom shortcodes, [create an issue](https://github.com/grafana/writers-toolkit/issues).
{{% /admonition %}}

## Admonition

The `admonition` shortcode renders its content in a blockquote or stylized banner.
The style depends on the admonition type as defined in Writers' Toolkit [Style conventions]({{< relref "../style-guide/style-conventions" >}}).

The content of the admonition must be within opening and closing tags,
and the type of admonition must be within quotes.

| Parameter | Description                                                            | Required |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `type`    | The type of admonition. One of `caution`, `note`, `tip`, or `warning`. | yes      |

Use a tip when you want to show the reader _how_ to do something that isnâ€™t necessarily obvious.
Tips are intended to be helpful, additional information. You can think of some tips as tricks.
Your reader can feel free to skip them if they wish because they do not contribute to core understanding.

{{% admonition type="warning" %}}
Reference style links such as `[link text][label]` or `[link text][]` do not work in the inner text of shortcodes.
For more information, refer to [Markdown Reference Links in Shortcodes](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/markdown-reference-links-in-shortcodes/5770/3).
{{% /admonition %}}

### Example

The following example renders an admonition of type `note` with the message `Kingston is the capital of Jamaica.`:

```markdown
{{%/* admonition type="note" */%}}
Kingston is the capital of Jamaica.
{{%/* /admonition */%}}
```

### Example

The following example renders an admonition of type `tip` with the message `This also applies to headings that contain a forward slash or parentheses or square brackets.`:

```markdown
{{%/* admonition type="tip" */%}}
This also applies to headings that contain a forward slash or parentheses or square brackets.
{{%/* /admonition */%}}
```

## Code

The `code` shortcode provides the ability to show multiple snippets of code in different languages. When a language is selected, other code blocks on the page are toggled if the language is included. The selected language is saved to browser and persists across navigation.

### Example

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
If your repository uses `prettier` to format the files, use the HTML comments `<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->` and `<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->` around the shortcode tags to ensure correct rendering.
{{% /admonition %}}

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

````markdown
{{</* code */>}}

```bash
curl "https://your-stack.grafana.net/api/plugins/grafana-incident-app/resources/api/v1/ActivityService.AddActivity"
```

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
)

func main() {

  ...
```

```javascript
import { GrafanaIncidentClient, ActivityService } from '@grafana/incident-node';

// https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/incident/api/auth/#get-a-service-account-token
const serviceAccountToken = process.env.GRAFANA_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN;
const client = new GrafanaIncidentClient(
  "https://your-stack.grafana.net",
  serviceAccountToken
);

...
```

```json
POST https://your-stack.grafana.net/api/plugins/grafana-incident-app/resources/api/v1/ActivityService.AddActivity
Content-Type="application/json; charset=utf-8"
Authorization: Bearer glsa_HOruNAb7SOiCdshU9algkrq7F...
```

{{</* /code */>}}
````
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Collapse

The `collapse` shortcode toggles visibility of sections of content, often helpful when hiding and showing large amounts of content.

| Parameter | Description                         | Required |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| `title`   | Text explaining the hidden content. | yes      |

### Example

```markdown
{{</* collapse title="Title of hidden content" */>}}
Kingston is the capital of Jamaica.
{{</* /collapse */>}}
```

Produces:

{{< collapse title="Title of hidden content" >}}
Kingston is the capital of Jamaica.
{{< /collapse >}}

Use this shortcode for:

- [Deprecated content](#deprecation-example): Features that have been deprecated, but still need to be documented for some time.
- [Configuration options](#configuration-options-example): Features that have several ways they can be configured.

Add a lead-in sentence and a title that, taken together, are descriptive enough for the reader to guess what's included in the collapsed content. Don't duplicate headings in the title parameter.

You can't do the following with this shortcode:

- Use them as page headings
- Control the size of the title text
- Add images or videos between the shortcode tags

### Deprecation example

```markdown
#### BoltDB (deprecated)

The following example is for a deprecated store and shouldn't be used for new Loki deployments:

{{</* collapse title="boltdb-shipper" */>}}
Also known as _boltdb-shipper_ during development (and is still the schema store name).
The single store configurations for Loki utilize the chunk store for both chunks and the index, requiring just one store to run Loki.
{{</* /collapse */>}}
```

Produces:

#### BoltDB (deprecated)

The following example is for a deprecated store and shouldn't be used for new Loki deployments:

{{< collapse title="boltdb-shipper" >}}
Also known as _boltdb-shipper_ during development (and is still the schema store name).
The single store configurations for Loki to utilize the chunk store for both chunks and the index, which requires just one store to run Loki.
{{< /collapse >}}

### Configuration options example

````markdown
#### 6-Compactor-Snippet.yaml

The following partial configuration sets the compactor to use S3 and run the compaction every five minutes.
Downloaded index files for compaction are stored in `/loki/compactor`.

{{</* collapse title="Example" */>}}

```yaml
compactor:
  working_directory: /tmp/loki/compactor
  shared_store: s3
  compaction_interval: 5m
```

{{</* /collapse */>}}
````

Produces:

#### 6-Compactor-Snippet.yaml

The following partial configuration sets the compactor to use Amazon S3 and runs the compaction every 5 minutes.
Downloaded index files for compaction are stored in `/loki/compactor`.

{{< collapse title="Example" >}}

```yaml
compactor:
  working_directory: /tmp/loki/compactor
  shared_store: s3
  compaction_interval: 5m
```

{{< /collapse >}}

## Docs/experimental-deployment

The `docs/experimental-deployment` shortcode produces a note admonition with the preferred copy for explaining that the described deployment is experimental.

It takes no parameters.

### Example

```markdown
{{</* docs/experimental-deployment */>}}
```

Produces:

{{< docs/experimental-deployment >}}

## Docs/experimental

The `docs/experimental` shortcode produces a note admonition with the preferred copy for explaining that the described product or feature is experimental.

| Parameter     | Description                                                              | Required |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `product`     | The name of the product or feature.                                      | yes      |
| `featureFlag` | The name of the feature flag users use to enable the product or feature. | yes      |

### Example

```markdown
{{</* docs/experimental product="experimental-feature" featureFlag="its-feature-flag" */>}}
```

Produces:

{{< docs/experimental product="experimental-feature" featureFlag="its-feature-flag" >}}

## Docs/private-preview

The `docs/private-preview` shortcode produces a note admonition with the preferred copy for explaining that the described product or feature is in private preview.

| Parameter | Description                         | Required |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| `product` | The name of the product or feature. | yes      |

```markdown
{{</* docs/private-preview product="private-preview-feature" */>}}
```

Produces:

{{< docs/private-preview product="private-preview-feature" >}}

## Docs/public-preview

The `docs/public-preview` shortcode produces a note admonition with the preferred copy for explaining that the described product or feature is in public preview.

| Parameter     | Description                                                              | Required |

```

Produces:

{{< docs/public-preview product="public-preview-feature" featureFlag="its-feature-flag" >}}

## Docs/shared

The `docs/shared` shortcode lets you reuse content across the Grafana website by including shared pages from source content repositories. The source content repository must explicitly share the page by placing it into its `shared` directory.

To share content, follow these steps:

1. Create a Markdown file containing the source to be shared and include `headless: true` in the front matter to prevent the website from publishing the page.
1. Store the file in a shared folder.
1. To include the shared content in a Markdown file, insert the `docs/shared` shortcode with the following named parameters:

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Required |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `lookup`      | Path to the included content relative to the root of the shared directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | yes      |
| `source`      | Name of the source content as shown on the website. For example, for https://grafana.com/docs/enterprise-metrics/ content, the _source_ is `enterprise-metrics`.                                                                                                                                                     | yes      |
| `version`     | Version of the source content to include. For source content that does not have a version, use the empty string `""` as the value. Version substitution is supported using values like `<GRAFANA VERSION>`. To learn about version substitution, refer to [About version substitution](#about-version-substitution). | yes      |
| `leveloffset` | Manipulates source content headings up to a maximum level of `h6`. Only positive offsets are currently supported. `leveloffset="+5"` ensures an `h1` in the source content is an `h6` in the destination content.                                                                                                    | no       |

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Hugo doesn't rebuild the destination file when a source file changes on disk.
To trigger a rebuild after changes to a source file, perform a trivial change to the destination file and save that, too.
{{% /admonition %}}

### Examples

The following shortcode inserts the content from the `oauth2-block.md` file. The _lookup_ path is relative to the `shared` folder in the `agent` source repository.

```markdown
{{</* docs/shared lookup="flow/reference/components/oauth2-block.md" source="agent" version="<AGENT VERSION>" */>}}
```

The following shortcode inserts the latest version of `shared-page.md` from the `shared` folder in the `enterprise-metrics` project.
Headings are offset by one level, so if the source content contains an `h1`, the resulting heading is an `h2`.

```markdown
{{</* docs/shared lookup="shared-page.md" source="enterprise-metrics" version="<GEM VERSION>" leveloffset="+1" */>}}
```

## Figure

The `figure` shortcode renders an image with a caption using an HTML [`<figure>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure#usage_notes) element. This shortcode allows you more control over how an image is rendered, but if you don't need these options, you can use [basic Markdown to add images]({{< relref "../markdown-guide#images" >}}).

To add a figure, insert the `figure` shortcode with the following named parameters:

| Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Required |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `alt`           | If set, `alt` specifies the alt text for the image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | no       |
| `animated-gif`  | If set, the HTML contains a div with an image link instead of a `<figure>` element. It's typically used for animated screenshots. Shortcode parameters other than the _caption_ and _maxWidth_ parameters are ignored.                                                                          | no       |
| `caption`       | Describes the figure using a [`<figcaption>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption) element.                                                                                                                                                                    | no       |
| `caption-align` | Can be used to change the alignment of the `caption` property. Accepted values are `left`, `center`, and `right`.                                                                                                                                                                               | no       |
| `class`         | Can be used to override the HTML class for the `<figure>` element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | no       |
| `link-class`    | Can be used to override the HTML class for the `<a>` element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | no       |
| `lazy`          | If set to `"false"`, an additional `lazyload` class is **not** applied to the image. The `lazyload` class lets a browser render a page before the figure image loads. Once the image loads, the placeholder box transitions to the loaded image. Defaults to `"true"`.                          | no       |
| `lightbox`      | If set to `"true"`, an additional `figure-wrapper__lightbox` class is applied to the `<figure>`.                                                                                                                                                                                                | no       |
| `link`          | If set the value overrides the `src` shortcode parameter as the value to the `href` in the `<a>` element in the `<figure>`.                                                                                                                                                                     | no       |
| `height`        | If set, `_height_` controls the height of the `<img>` element using the [`height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height) CSS property. When specifying a value, it should be an integer representing pixels without a `"px"` string at the end, for example `"500"`.         | no       |
| `width`         | If set, `_width_` controls the width of the `<img>` element using the [`width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) CSS property. When specifying a value, it should be an integer representing pixels without a `"px"` string at the end, for example `"500"`.             | no       |
| `max-width`     | If set, `_max-width_` controls the maximum width of the `<figure>` element using the [`max-width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-width) CSS property. When specifying a length or percentage, value should include unit of measurement, for example `"75px"` or `"25%"`. | no       |
| `show-caption`  | If set to `"true"`, the rendered `<figure>` includes a `<figcaption>` element with the caption set in _caption_. Defaults to `"true"`.                                                                                                                                                          | no       |
| `src`           | Sets the source of the image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | yes      |

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Including the original image dimensions as the 'width' and 'height' properties is highly recommended, as it improves page performance and SEO. These values are _only_ used for determining the image aspect ratio and don't equate to the final displayed size.
{{% /admonition %}}

### Example

In this example, the image has a CSS class that makes the image display floated to the right.

```markdown
{{</* figure class="float-right"  src="/static/img/docs/grafana-cloud/k8sPods.png" caption="Pod view in Grafana Kubernetes Monitoring" */>}}
```

In this example, the image's display size is changed to have a maximum width of 50%. The `max-width` value must have a unit of measurement, such as pixels or percentages.

```markdown
{{</* figure max-width="50%" src="/static/img/docs/grafana-cloud/k8sPods.png" caption="Pod view in Grafana Kubernetes Monitoring" */>}}
```

In this example, the image's display size is changed to have a maximum width of 500px, and the `class` and `link-class` properties are used to center the image on the page. The original `width` and `height` values from the image are included without any unit of measurement (such as pixels or percentages).

```markdown
{{</* figure src="/static/img/docs/grafana-cloud/k8sPods.png" width="1275" height="738" max-width="500px" class="w-100p" link-class="w-fit mx-auto d-flex flex-direction-column" caption="Pod view in Grafana Kubernetes Monitoring" caption-align="center" */>}}
```

The `relref` shortcode provides build-time link checking to ensure that the destination file exists.

For example: `{{</* relref "./path/to/file" */>}}`.

| Parameter  | Description      | Required |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| position 0 | The file lookup. | yes      |

The argument is an absolute or relative file lookup.
An absolute lookup begins with a slash (`/`) and starts from the site root.
For example, to link to the Grafana Cloud index page, the `relref` shortcode argument is `{{</* relref "/docs/grafana-cloud/_index.md" */>}}`.

Using the full path to file, including the extension, can break the lookup if the destination file changes from a page to a leaf or branch bundle.
To avoid this, omit the file extension and any `/_index` or `/index` part of the lookup.
Using the previous example of the Grafana Cloud index page, the preferred `relref` shortcode argument is `{{</* relref "/docs/grafana-cloud" */>}}`.

Hugo link checking only applies to the content available during the build.
In most projects, the only content available during local builds and CI is the current project documentation,
so you should be aware that just because a link uses a `relref`, it doesn't automatically follow that the link can be checked.

### Determine `relref` shortcode arguments

To determine the path between the source and destination content, do the following:

Find the directory where the destination content lives.
Find the directory that the source and destination directories have in common.
Note the relative path from the common directory to the destination directory.
Count the number of folders from the source to the common directory and that number equals the number of parent directory path elements (`..`) you need to add to your relative path.
Join all the path elements together with forward slashes (`/`).

For example, with the following folder structure:

```
Vehicles
â”œâ”€â”€ Trucks
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ F150
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 1999 F150
â””â”€â”€ Vans
```

In this case, the source content is in the `1999 F150` directory and the destination content is in the `Vans` directory.
The common folder for the two pieces of content is the `Vehicles` directory.

The parent directory of `1999 F150` is `Trucks`, requiring one `..` path element.
To parent directory of `Trucks` is `Vehicles`, requiring another `..` path element.
Therefore, the relative path from the source directory, `1999 F150`, and the common directory, `Vehicles`, is `../..`

The pathway from the common directory `Vehicles` to destination directory `Vans` is `vans`
The relative path is `../../vans`

If the source directory was `Vans` and the destination was `1999 F150`, the relative path would be `../trucks/F150/1999-F150`.

## Responsive-table

The `responsive-table` shortcode wraps the table within the shortcode tags with a class that makes the table responsive to the browser window.
This results in a table with horizontal scrolling that is fixed to the width of the containing element.

Without the `responsive-table` shortcode, a table can often overflow its containing element and text can be hidden by neighboring elements like the table of contents.

### Example

```markdown
{{%/* responsive-table */%}}
| Heading, column one | Heading, column two |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Row one, column one | Row one, column two |
{{%/* /responsive-table */%}}
```

## Section

The `section` shortcode renders an unordered list of links to a page's child pages. To add a section, insert the `section` shortcode with the following optional parameters:

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Required |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `menuTitle`        | If set to `"true"`, the _menuTitle_ parameter modifies the template to use the child page's `menuTitle` front matter instead of the page title as the text in the link. If the child page doesn't have a `menuTitle` parameter, the title is used instead. | no       |
| `ordered`          | If set to `"true"`, the _ordered_ parameter modifies the template to use an ordered list instead of an unordered list, displaying each item with a number marker                                                                                           | no       |
| `withDescriptions` | If set to `"true"`, the _withDescriptions_ parameter modifies the template to include the front matter descriptions for child pages that have them.                                                                                                        | no       |

### Examples

The following shortcode inserts a list of links to child pages.
The links are named using the value of `menuTitle` from the front matter of the child page.

```markdown
{{</* section menuTitle="true"*/>}}
```

The following shortcode inserts a lists of links to child pages and includes the `description` content from the front matter of each child page.

```markdown
{{</* section withDescriptions="true"*/>}}
```

## Term

The `term` shortcode enables a tooltip when a user hovers above text surrounded by the shortcode.

| Parameter  | Description         | Required |
| ---------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| position 0 | Glossary lookup key | yes      |

### Examples

```markdown
{{</* term "data source" */>}}data sources{{</* /term */>}}
```

```markdown
Grafana comes with built-in support for many {{</* term "data source" */>}}data sources{{</* /term */>}}.
```

Produces:

Grafana comes with built-in support for many {{< term "data source" >}}data sources{{< /term >}}.

Lookup keys and the associated definitions are defined internally.
If you are a Grafana Labs employee and want to make changes, edit [`glossary.yaml`](https://github.com/grafana/website/blob/master/data/glossary.yaml).

### Guidance

For terms with multiple definitions, follow the common dictionary practice of numbering each alternative.
For an example, refer to the definition of [graph](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/graph).

## Video shortcodes

Refer to the [`vimeo` and `youtube` shortcode documentation]({{< relref "../image-guidelines#videos" >}}) for information about these shortcodes.

## Docs/reference

The `docs/reference` shortcode lets you specify different destinations for the same link that depend on where the source file is published.
Use this shortcode when content from one repository is published to more than one documentation set.

All possible destinations are set in one part of the file (usually at end of the file, like a footer).

For example, a page in versioned Grafana documentation is also mounted in the Grafana Cloud documentation.
The page in Grafana should link to the Grafana dashboards page but the page in Grafana Cloud should link to the Grafana Cloud dashboards page.

Set the reference at the end of the page as follows:

```markdown
{{%/* docs/reference */%}}
[dashboards]: "/docs/grafana/ -> /docs/grafana/<GRAFANA VERSION>/dashboards"
[dashboards]: "/docs/grafana-cloud/ -> /docs/grafana-cloud/dashboards"
{{%/* /docs/reference */%}}
```

The content within the shortcode tags is as follows:

`[LABEL]: "PROJECT PATH PREFIX -> REFERENCE"`

- _`LABEL`_ - The label you'll use in the reference-style links in the file.
  In the example above, the label is `dashboards`.
  The label can be multiple words (for example, [dashboard docs]) and can include spaces.

- _`PROJECT PATH PREFIX`_ - Designates the target project.
  In the example above, the path prefixes are `/docs/grafana/` for Grafana and `/docs/grafana-cloud/` for Cloud.

- _`REFERENCE`_ - The path to the destination file.
  Version substitution is supported using values like `<GRAFANA VERSION>`.
  To learn about version substitution, refer to [About version substitution](#about-version-substitution).

Then add the link in the body of the file in the following format:

```markdown
For more information about Grafana dashboards, refer to [Dashboards][dashboards].
```

- If the page you're on is `/docs/grafana-cloud/alerting/`, the returned link is `/docs/grafana-cloud/dashboards/`.
- If the page you're on is `/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/`, the inferred version is `latest`, and the returned link is `/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/`.
- If the page you're on is `/docs/grafana/next/alerting/`, the inferred version is `next`, and the returned link is `/docs/grafana/next/dashboards/`.

### Other use cases

Markdown reference-style links are also useful when you want to link to the same destination multiple times in one file.
It allows you to specify the link destination once while you use the label multiple times.
For example:

**Reference:**

```markdown
[Grafana website]: www.grafana.com
```

**Body text:**

```markdown
Find more information on [Grafana][Grafana website].
```

## Escaping Hugo shortcodes

If you need to display the syntax for a shortcode, you can escape it using this syntax:

![Escaped shortcode](./writers-toolkit-escaped-shortcode.png)

This Markdown renders as:

```markdown
{{</* myshortcode */>}}
```

## About version substitution

Version substitution enables the use of absolute paths that resolve correctly, irrespective of version.
It uses special syntax using angle bracket delimiters like `<GRAFANA_VERSION>`.

As a convention, use the name of the target project all upper-case.
For example, `grafana` becomes `GRAFANA`, `grafana-cloud` becomes `GRAFANA CLOUD`.

The special syntax `<SOMETHING_VERSION>` is substituted by the version that is inferred from the page's URL.
If the page's URL has the prefix `/docs/grafana/latest/`, the syntax `<SOMETHING_VERSION>` is replaced by `latest` in the final URL.

You can override version inference by including additional metadata in the front matter of the file.
To override the value of `<GRAFANA_VERSION>`, set the `GRAFANA_VERSION` parameter in the page's front matter.
For example, to set the version to `next` irrespective of the source content version, add the following to the front matter: `GRAFANA_VERSION: next`.
