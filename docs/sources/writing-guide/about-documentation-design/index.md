# About our documentation design

The documentation website uses a modern design approach to make our technical documentation accessible, modern, and scalable.  

Our technical documentation pages take advantage of our static site generator, Hugo. As a result, several elements of the page are automatically managed during the publication of the page using Hugo's taxonomy. Thus, the source markdown files **do not need to hand management** of these elements and **do not require** contributors to curate them.

We also include:

- **Navigation to preview primary topics.** The left-hand sidebar broadly outlines key topics, with nested related topics underneath. This design supports the philosophy that "every page is page one" and creates an system of documentation around a topic that is easier to reference and navigate. 
- **Floating table of contents.** The table of contents floats on the page as you scroll to the content that's hidden beneath the fold. You can also view the upcoming topics, to enable a better user experience that helps you navigate to subtopics lower on the page.
- **Auto-generated _Related documentation_.** Using Hugo's taxonomy, our documentation automatically finds other documentation that's pertinent to the page you're viewing.
- **Auto-generated _Related resources from Grafana Labs_.** Hugo's taxonomy again is used to automatically generate this content.
- **Feedback.** We added more prominent options for feedback from our community.
