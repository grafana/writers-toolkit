# Topic types

Grafana Labs documentation is made up of different topic types: _concept_, _task_, and _reference_. We encourage you to use these topic types when you write content.

Depending on the needs of a particular product area, select a topic type from the following table to learn about each.

| Type                                     | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Concept]({{< relref "concept/" >}})     | Provides an overview and background information. Answers the question "What is it?".                                                                   |
| [Task]({{< relref "task/" >}})           | Provides numbered steps that describe how to achieve an outcome. Answers the question "How do I?".                                                     |
| [Reference]({{< relref "reference/" >}}) | Provides users with the information they might need to refer to during a task. Answers the question "What details do I need to accomplish this task?". |
| [Tutorial] | Provides procedures that users can safely reproduce and learn from. Answers the question: "Can you teach me to …?" |

For your convenience, we have created topic [templates](https://github.com/grafana/writers-toolkit/tree/main/docs/static/templates).
