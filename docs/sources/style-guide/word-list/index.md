# Word list

In most cases, you can refer to the [word list in the Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list) to determine if you should use a word or not. The following guidelines cover cases in which:

- Grafana guidelines differ from Google guidelines.
- The word isn't included in Google guidelines.
- It's still easy to use the wrong word because it's widely used in general or in other Grafana media.
