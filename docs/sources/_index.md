# Grafana Labs technical-documentation toolkit

Hi, it’s nice to see you.

We’re here to help you make the technical documentation at Grafana Labs accurate and shiny.
Whether this is your first pull request (PR) or whether you are a long-time contributor,
we’re here to help you create content that is consistent, and that applies the voice and tone of Grafana Labs.
We understand if you are in a hurry and just want to get something done,
or if you prefer to ask us a writing question and to learn along the way through doing.

This toolkit is for anyone who writes or edits customer-facing technical documentation of Grafana or other Grafana Labs products.
It is the source of truth for voice and tone, grammar and style, templates, and more.

This toolkit consists of two guides:

- Style guide
- Writing guide

## Iteration is your friend

As we share feedback with each other about this toolkit, let’s continue to evolve it.
Some areas of content that are subject for inclusion come from the Design, Internationalization, and the Accessibility teams.
