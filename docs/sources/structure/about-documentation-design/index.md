# About documentation design at Grafana Labs

<!-- vale Grafana.GoogleWe = NO -->
<!-- According to https://developers.google.com/style/pronouns#personal-pronouns, it is acceptable to use personal pronouns "after using your organization's name". -->

Our documentation website uses a modern design approach to make technical documentation accessible and scalable.

Documentation pages take advantage of the static site generator Hugo.
As a result, several elements of the page are automatically managed during the publication of the page using Hugo's taxonomy.
Thus, the source Markdown files _don't need to hand management_ of these elements and _don't require_ contributors to curate them.

Pages also include:

- **Navigation to preview primary topics.**
  The left-hand sidebar broadly outlines key topics, with nested related topics underneath.
  This design supports the philosophy that "every page is page one" and creates an system of documentation around a topic that's easier to reference and navigate.
- **Floating table of contents.**
  The table of contents floats on the page as you scroll to the content that's hidden beneath the fold.
  You can also view the upcoming topics, to enable a better user experience that helps you navigate to subtopics lower on the page.
- **Auto-generated _Related documentation_.**
  Using Hugo's taxonomy, documentation automatically finds other documentation that's related to the page you're viewing.
- **Auto-generated _Related resources from Grafana Labs_.**
  Hugo's taxonomy again automatically generates this content.
- **Feedback.**
  Thumbs up and thumbs down feedback.
