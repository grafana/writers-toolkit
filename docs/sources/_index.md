# Writers’ Toolkit

<!-- vale Google.Exclamation = NO -->

Welcome!

<!-- vale Google.Exclamation = YES -->

We're glad you're here to help make our technical documentation even better. We aim to develop content that leads our users to success using products developed by Grafana Labs.

By creating Writers’ Toolkit, we want to empower everyone to create technical documentation that is consistent and applies the voice and tone we use at Grafana Labs so that our documentation is truly a reflection of who we are.

Writers’ Toolkit is for anyone who writes or edits customer-facing technical documentation for Grafana Labs. Use it as the source of truth for voice and tone, grammar and style, templates, and much, much more.

Our style guide is based on [Google's developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style). If you can't find guidance on a specific topic in the Writers' Toolkit, refer to Google's style guide.

If you're new to the guide, start with the [Get started]({{< relref "get-started" >}}) section.

## Iteration is our friend

This is just a start. We will continue to share our guidelines and seek feedback and iterate. Our hope is that these pages and our understanding continues and evolves over time. Over time, we will expand Writers’ Toolkit.

## Questions and Feedback

The Writers' Toolkit is open-source and available at [grafana/writers-toolkit](https://github.com/grafana/writers-toolkit). If you have questions, or feedback on how we can improve it, we encourage you to open an issue and help us make this an even better resource.
