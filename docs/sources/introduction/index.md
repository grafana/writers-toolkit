# Introduction to documentation

Grafana Labs keeps technical documentation alongside the project code it documents.

Some open source projects and their repositories are:

- Grafana: https://github.com/grafana/grafana
- Grafana Agent: https://github.com/grafana/agent
- Grafana k6: https://github.com/grafana/k6-docs
- Grafana Loki: https://github.com/grafana/loki
- Grafana Mimir: https://github.com/grafana/mimir
- Grafana Tempo: https://github.com/grafana/tempo

Each repository contains a `docs/sources` directory containing documentation source files.

## Topic-based authoring

The technical writing team at Grafana Labs uses topic-based authoring.
Topic-based authoring is a modular approach to content creation where content is structured around topics that can be mixed and reused in different contexts.

For more information on topic types, refer to [Topic types]({{< relref "../structure/topic-types" >}}).

Why is topic-based authoring important?

- **Writing that isn’t topic-based is difficult to reuse.** If everyone frequently copies information to multiple locations and makes small modifications, the result is rework and increases in errors, which multiplies the costs associated with maintenance and translation.

- **Writing that isn’t topic-based is difficult for readers to understand.** Content, structure, terminology, and writing style differs and can confuse and frustrate readers.

- **Writing that is topic-based is more consistent and user-friendly.**
  Users can find the information they are looking for quickly and easily.
  It has a more consistent format and voice, clearly defining the Grafana brand.

## Markdown

Grafana writes technical documentation using Markdown.
For more information, refer to the [Markdown style guide](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/write/markdown-guide/).
