| UI element | Description | Image | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|-------|
| breadcrumbs | The area at the top of the screen that displays your location in the application and allows you to navigate between the displayed locations. |  | Don't refer to this as the _navigation bar_, _top navigation_, or _header_ except in the case of the dashboard header (see below). |
| dashboard header | The area at the top of the screen that displays your location in the application and includes dashboard tools. |  |  |
| dialog box | A box that's appears on top of the main screen of the application where you can enter information or select commands. |  | Don't use _modal_ or _dialog_ without _box_. |
| main menu | The navigation that opens on the left side of the screen when you click the menu icon (see below). |  | Don't refer to this as the _navigation menu_ or _primary menu_. |
| menu icon | The element that opens the main menu |  | Don't refer to this as the _hamburger menu_. |
| panel header | The area at the of a panel that contains the panel name, the edit menu, and other indicators. |  |  |
| switch | Used to turn UI features on and off. | ![Switch](/media/docs/writers-toolkit/ui-elements/switch.png) | Don't refer to this as a _toggle_. |
| tab | An element that lets multiple pages exist within one screen. |  | Other UI elements, such as radio button groups ([example 1](), [example 2]()), behave much like tabs, but shouldn't be referred to as tabs; avoid naming these elements, using just the element label instead. |
