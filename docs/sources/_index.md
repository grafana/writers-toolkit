# Writers' toolkit for technical documentation provided by Grafana Labs

<!-- vale Grafana.Exclamation = NO -->

Welcome!

<!-- vale Grafana.Exclamation = YES -->

We're glad you're here to help make our technical documentation even better. We aim to develop content that leads our users to success using products developed by Grafana Labs.

By creating this Toolkit, we want to empower everyone to create technical documentation that is consistent and applies the voice and tone we use at Grafana Labs so that our documentation is truly a reflection of who we are.

This Toolkit is for anyone who writes or edits customer-facing technical documentation for Grafana Labs. Use it as the source of truth for voice and tone, grammar and style, templates, and much, much more.

This Toolkit consists of two primary guides:

- Style guide
- Writing guide

## Iteration is our friend

This is just a start. We will continue to share our guidelines and seek feedback and iterate. Our hope is that these pages and our understanding continues and evolves over time. Over time, we will expand this Toolkit.
