# Concept title

<!-- The concept title is required. Use a noun-based title that includes the name of the product or feature. For example: Alerting fundamentals.

A concept provides an overview and background information to help users understand a product, interface, or task. Concepts answer the question “what is it?”. Readers learn about features through concepts. Concepts do not include step-by-step procedures or reference material but often link to those materials.

Refer to the [Concept topic documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/topic-types/concept/) for guidelines on writing a concept topic.
-->

Introduce the concept.

<!-- The introduction is required. Add an introduction to the concept to summarize the purpose or main point of the feature. -->

## Sections

<!-- Add sections replacing **Sections** with subtitles for each section. Concept topics or sections explain what and why. They do not explain how. If you are a new user, you might look for concept information to learn about what Grafana is, why it might be useful to you, and what the general workflow is. -->

## Useful links

<!-- Link out to task or reference topics related to the concept. -->
