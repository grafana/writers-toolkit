# Documentation templates

This section provides you with a collection of templates to help you write your documentation.
Choose from concept, task, or reference and get started quickly.

Although we don’t distinguish between different types of content when we create new topics in Markdown, it is important to follow a clearly defined structure so our documentation has a consistent look and feel to our users.

We write three core documentation types:

**Concept:** Describes how and why something works. Concepts answer the question "what is it?". When readers read concepts, they are learning about a topic. Use concepts to help the reader understand a technology, before they start using it.

**Task:** Gives specific instructions about how to get something done. Tasks answer the question "how do I do it?". When readers read tasks, they are doing something. Tasks tend to have a specific goal and consist of a set of numbered steps that the reader can follow to achieve that goal.

**Reference:** Contains structured information or specifications that users need to make a product work. Reference material answers the question "what else do I need to know?" When readers read references, they are fact-checking. Reference sections should comprehensively catalog data such as functions and their parameters, return codes and error messages. They are often presented as tables, bulleted lists, or sample scripts.

Our templates follow these documentation types, and you should find that your information naturally fits into them as you write.
