# Visualization title

<!-- The visualization title is required. This is the name of the visualization as it appears in the UI. For example: Time series.

A visualization topic provides an overview to help end users understand how to best use the visualization type and the options available to them in the user interface (UI). Visualization topics always include conceptual and reference content and may include task content.

Refer to the [Visualization topic documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/topic-types/visualization/) for guidelines on writing a concept topic.
-->

Introduce the concept.

<!-- The introduction is required. Add an introduction to the visualization that explains what visualization type can help the user do. -->

## Supported data formats

<!-- Provide guidance about which data formats are supported by the visualization type with example use cases. Does not apply to a widget topic. -->

## [A] options

<!-- For each drop-down section of options in the edit panel add a section in the topic with the name of the UI section, followed by the word "options." Generally, these don't require screenshots. Only add screenshots where the UI is potentially confusing or a UI interaction is unclear. This doesn't include the sections linked from the **Other options** section. -->

## [B] options

<!-- For each drop-down section of options in the edit panel add a section in the topic with the name of the UI section, followed by the word "options." Generally, these don't require screenshots. Only add screenshots where the UI is potentially confusing or a UI interaction is unclear. This doesn't include the sections linked from the **Other options** section. -->

## Other options

<!-- Link out to common visualization options Use H3s for each section to make them easily scannable. -->
