# Shortcodes

Shortcodes are predefined templates used for rendering snippets in Hugo.

## Why use shortcodes?

Markdown is limited in its ability to render complex elements. Although you might be tempted to insert HTML directly into content to make up for its limitations, you can instead use shortcodes to ensure consistency across the Grafana website.

The following sections describe shortcodes available for use in Grafana Markdown files. To learn about other shortcodes, refer to the Hugo [shortcode documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/).

> **Note for internal Grafana Labs contributors**: The Grafana shortcode templates are defined in the `layouts/shortcodes` folder of the website repo. To request custom shortcodes, [create an issue](https://github.com/grafana/writers-toolkit/issues).

## `admonition` shortcode

The `admonition` shortcode renders its content in a blockquote or stylized banner.
The style depends on the admonition type as defined in Writers' Toolkit [Style conventions]({{< relref "../style-guide/style-conventions" >}}).

The content of the admonition must be within opening and closing tags.

| Parameter | Description                                                           | Required |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `type`    | The type of admonition. One of `"note"`, `"caution"`, or `"warning"`. | yes      |

### Example

The following snippet renders an admonition of _type_ `"note"` with the message `Kingston is the capital of Jamaica`.

```markdown
{{%/* admonition type="note" */%}}
Kingston is the capital of Jamaica.
{{%/* /admonition */%}}
```

## `docs/shared` shortcode

The `docs/shared` shortcode lets you reuse content across the Grafana website by including shared pages from source content repositories. The source content repository must explicitly share the page by placing it into its `shared` directory.

To share content, follow these steps:

1. Create a Markdown file containing the source to be shared and include `headless: true` in the front matter to prevent the website from publishing the page.
1. Store the file in a shared folder.
1. To include the shared content in a Markdown file, insert the `docs/shared` shortcode with the following named parameters:

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Required |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `lookup`      | Path to the included content relative to the root of the shared directory.                                                                                                                                                                        | yes      |
| `source`      | Name of the source content as shown on the website. For example, for https://grafana.com/docs/enterprise-metrics/ content, the _source_ is `enterprise-metrics`.                                                                                  | yes      |
| `version`     | Version of the source content to include. If not provided, _version_ is implicitly set to match the version of the destination content. If the including destination is at version `1.0.0`, then the version of included content is `1.0.0` also. | no       |
| `leveloffset` | Manipulates source content headings up to a maximum level of `h6`. Only positive offsets are currently supported. `leveloffset="+5"` ensures an `h1` in the source content is an `h6` in the destination content.                                 | no       |

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
Hugo doesn't rebuild the destination file when a source file changes on disk.
To trigger a rebuild after changes to a source file, perform a trivial change to the destination file and save that, too.
{{% /admonition %}}

### Examples

The following shortcode inserts the content from the `oauth2-block.md` file. The _lookup_ path is relative to the `shared` folder in the `agent` source repository.

```markdown
{{</* docs/shared lookup="flow/reference/components/oauth2-block.md" source="agent" */>}}
```

The following shortcode inserts the latest version of `shared-page.md` from the `shared` folder in the `enterprise-metrics` project.
Headings are offset by one level, so if the source content contains an `h1`, the resulting heading is an `h2`.

```markdown
{{</* docs/shared lookup="shared-page.md" source="enterprise-metrics" version="latest" leveloffset="+1" */>}}
```

## `figure` shortcode

The `figure` shortcode renders an image with a caption using an HTML [`<figure>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure#usage_notes) element. This shortcode allows you more control over how an image is rendered, but if you don't need these options, you can use [basic Markdown to add images]({{< relref "../markdown-guide#images" >}}).

To add a figure, insert the `figure` shortcode with the following named parameters:

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Required |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `animated-gif` | If set, the HTML contains a div with an image link instead of a `<figure>` element. It's typically used for animated screenshots. Shortcode parameters other than the _caption_ and _maxWidth_ parameters are ignored.                                                               | no       |
| `caption`      | Describes the figure using a [`<figcaption>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption) element.                                                                                                                                                         | no       |
| `class`        | Can be optionally used to override the HTML class for the `<figure>` element.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | no       |
| `lazy`         | If set to `"false"`, an additional `lazyload` class is **not** applied to the image. The `lazyload` class lets a browser render a page before the figure image loads. Once the image loads, the placeholder box transitions to the loaded image. Defaults to `"true"`.               | no       |
| `lightbox`     | If set to `"true"`, an additional `figure-wrapper__lightbox` class is applied to the `<figure>`.                                                                                                                                                                                     | no       |
| `link`         | If set the value overrides the `src` shortcode parameter as the value to the `href` in the `<a>` element in the `<figure>`.                                                                                                                                                          | no       |
| `maxWidth`     | If set, _maxWidth_ controls the maximum width of the `<figure>` using the [`max-width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-width) CSS property. When specifying a length or percentage, value should include unit of measurement, for example `"75px"` or `"25%"`. | no       |
| `showCaption`  | If set to `"true"`, the rendered `<figure>` includes a `<figcaption>` element with the caption set in _caption_. Defaults to `"true"`.                                                                                                                                               | no       |
| `src`          | Sets the source of the image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | yes      |

### Example

In this example, the image has a CSS class that makes the image display floated to the right.

```markdown
{{</* figure class="float-right"  src="/static/img/docs/grafana-cloud/k8sPods.png" caption="Pod view in Grafana Kubernetes Monitoring" */>}}
```

In this example, the image's display size is changed to have a maximum width of 50%. The `max-width` value must have a unit of measurement, such as pixels or percentages.

```markdown
{{</* figure max-width="50%" src="/static/img/docs/grafana-cloud/k8sPods.png" caption="Pod view in Grafana Kubernetes Monitoring" */>}}
```

## `responsive-table` shortcode

The `responsive-table` shortcode wraps the table within the shortcode tags with a class that makes the table responsive to the browser window.
This results in a table with horizontal scrolling that is fixed to the width of the containing element.

Without the `responsive-table` shortcode, a table can often overflow its containing element and text can be hidden by neighboring elements like the table of contents.

### Example

```markdown
{{%/* responsive-table */%}}
| Heading, column one | Heading, column two |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Row one, column one | Row one, column two |
{{%/* /responsive-table */%}}
```

## `section` shortcode

The `section` shortcode renders an unordered list of links to a page's child pages. To add a section, insert the `section` shortcode with the following optional parameters:

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Required |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `menuTitle`        | If set to `"true"`, the _menuTitle_ parameter modifies the template to use the child page's `menuTitle` front matter instead of the page title as the text in the link. If the child page doesn't have a `menuTitle` parameter, the title is used instead. | no       |
| `ordered`          | If set to `"true"`, the _ordered_ parameter modifies the template to use an ordered list instead of an unordered list, displaying each item with a number marker                                                                                           | no       |
| `withDescriptions` | If set to `"true"`, the _withDescriptions_ parameter modifies the template to include the front matter descriptions for child pages that have them.                                                                                                        | no       |

### Examples

The following shortcode inserts a list of links to the pages's subpages. The links are named using the value of `menuTitle` from each subpage's front matter.

```markdown
{{</* section menuTitle="true"*/>}}
```

This shortcode inserts a lists of links to the page's subpages and includes the `description` content from each subpage's front matter.

```markdown
{{</* section withDescriptions="true"*/>}}
```

## Escaping Hugo shortcodes

If you need to display the syntax for a shortcode, you can escape it using this syntax:

![Escaped shortcode](./writers-toolkit-escaped-shortcode.png)

This Markdown renders as:

```markdown
{{</* myshortcode */>}}
```
