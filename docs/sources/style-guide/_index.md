# Grafana technical writing style guide

At Grafana Labs, we write technical documentation with this mission in mind: develop technically accurate, comprehensive documentation that leads users to answers, and be inclusive of multiple learning styles. Additionally, design documentation to scale writing resources while keeping a few things in mind:

**Simplify.** Explain everything—from products or services to related-but-highly-technical topics—in a way that any reader can understand.

**Respect.** Speak as though you are speaking to a friend. Use inclusive language. Be sympathetic, kind, and considerate. Don’t patronize, condescend, or mislead. Above all, don’t market or sell, but communicate useful information with real value.

**Clarify.** Use language that’s easy for everyone to understand.

Only write and publish content that’s relevant to users. Ask yourself:
1. Who is the audience?
1. How can this help them?
1. What must they know?	

When in doubt, defer to the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).

## Intended audience

This guide is intended for Grafana Labs technical writers and engineers, and it is also intended for open-source contributors to technical documentation.
