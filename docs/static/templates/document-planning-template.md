# Documentation plan

A typical documentation plan consists in an introduction, proposal, and content outline.

## Introduction

Introduce the documentation plan. Briefly describe the name and purpose of the new document(s). For each document, give a title, [topic type](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/writing-guide/topic-types/), and brief description.

**Example:**


| Title                     | Topic type                  |  Description                                     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| What is GraphyXY? | Conceptual           | Overview of how the new GraphyXY tool works.
| Getting started with GraphyXY | Getting started    | Build a simple 'hello graphy' application.   |
| Creating a GraphyXY dashboard    | How-to | A step-by-step guide for building dashboards. |

## Goal

What is the goal of the doc plan? If there is a time frame, when does the document need to be published by?

## Documentation users

Who will be reading your docs? For example, OSS developers, Grafana internal developers, end-users, and so on.

## Documentation content

Answer the following questions to help prepare for writing the new document.
- In order of importance, what are the main points you want to make?
- What sort of knowledge do users need to have before they can use this product/feature?
- What are the pain points or issues that the doc must help the user to resolve?
- What graphics or videos, if any, need to be created?
- What sample apps or demo, if any, need to be built?

### Content outline

We recommend structuring the content of the new document with the user's journey firmly in mind. Ask yourself what concepts a user needs to understand before beginning and address those clearly early on. Consider the order of tasks that users must perform and document them in the same order. 

If you can't clearly express a coherent journey for the users, you may need to interview more users or stakeholders. 

### Additional information

Depending on the scope of your project, your Doc Squad collaborator may ask for information such as the release calendar, source code repo location, related tracking tickets, and so on.
