# Writing guide

The writing guide defines the structured authoring environment we use to create documentation at Grafana Labs. If you write technical documentation for Grafana Labs, familiarize yourself with the guidelines that follow.

The guidelines are for anyone who is interested in improving Grafana Labs' technical content. They are intended to guide you on your documentation journey, whether you are requesting a change, editing a topic, or writing a set of documentation for a new product or feature from scratch.

If you are already familiar with the guidelines, feel free to get started from one of the [templates](https://github.com/grafana/writers-toolkit/tree/main/docs/static/templates).

We hope you find what you are looking for. If you don't, provide us with the feedback, so we can continuously improve this writing guide.
