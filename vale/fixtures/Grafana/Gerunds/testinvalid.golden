testinvalid.md:3:3:Grafana.Gerunds:For a task-based heading, start with a [bare infinitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitive#English), also known as a plain form or [base form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_verbs#Base_form) verb. In English, the imperative mood also uses the base form verb, so it looks the same as the bare infinitive. Task-based headings are frequently used in quickstarts, how-to documents, and tutorials. For a conceptual or non-task-based heading, use a [noun phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase) that doesn't start with an -ing verb. Noun-phrase headings are frequently used in concept documentation.
