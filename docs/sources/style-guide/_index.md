# Grafana technical writing style guide

At Grafana Labs, we write technical documentation with this mission in mind: develop technically accurate, comprehensive documentation that leads users to answers, and be inclusive of multiple learning styles. Additionally, design documentation to scale writing resources while keeping a few things in mind:

**Simplify.** Explain everything—from products or services to related-but-highly-technical topics—in a way that any reader can understand.

**Respect.** Speak as though you are speaking to a friend. Use inclusive language. Be sympathetic, kind, and considerate. Don’t patronize, condescend, or mislead. Above all, don’t market or sell, but communicate useful information with real value.

To do this, content should be:

**Clarify.** Use language that’s easy for everyone to understand.

Only write and publish content that’s relevant to users. Ask yourself:
1. Who is the audience?
1. How can this help them?
1. What must they know?	

When in doubt, defer to the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).

## Intended audience

This guide is intended for Grafana Labs technical writers and engineers, and it is also intended for open-source contributors to technical documentation.
