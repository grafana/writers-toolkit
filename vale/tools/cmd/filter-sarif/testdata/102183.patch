+# Configure SCIM provisioning
+
+System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an open standard that allows automated user provisioning and management. With SCIM, you can automate the provisioning of users and groups from your identity provider to Grafana.
+
+{{< admonition type="note" >}}
+Available in [Grafana Enterprise](../../../introduction/grafana-enterprise/) and [Grafana Cloud Advanced](/docs/grafana-cloud/).
+{{< /admonition >}}
+
+{{< admonition type="note" >}}
+This feature is behind the `enableSCIM` feature toggle.
+You can enable feature toggles through configuration file or environment variables.
+
+For more information, refer to the [feature toggles documentation](/docs/grafana/<GRAFANA_VERSION>/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#feature_toggles).
+{{< /admonition >}}
+
+## Benefits
+
+{{< admonition type="note" >}}
+SCIM provisioning only works SAML authentication.
+Other authentication methods aren't supported.
+{{< /admonition >}}
+
+SCIM offers several advantages for managing users and teams in Grafana:
+
+- **Automated user provisioning**: Automatically create, update, and disable users in Grafana when changes occur in your identity provider
+- **Automated team provisioning**: Automatically create, update, and delete teams in Grafana based on groups in your identity provider
+- **Reduced administrative overhead**: Eliminate manual user management tasks and reduce the risk of human error
+- **Enhanced security**: Automatically disable access when users leave your organization
+
+## Supported identity providers
+
+The following identity providers are supported:
+
+- [Azure AD](../configure-authentication/azuread/)
+- [Okta](../configure-authentication/saml/)
+
+## How it works
+
+The synchronization process works as follows:
+
+1. Configure SCIM in both your identity provider and Grafana
+2. Your identity provider sends SCIM requests to the Grafana SCIM API endpoint
+3. Grafana processes these requests to create, update, or deactivate users and teams, and synchronize team memberships
+
+## Comparison with other sync methods
+
+Grafana offers several methods for synchronizing users, teams, and roles.
+The following table compares SCIM with other synchronization methods to help you understand its advantages:
+
+| Sync Method                                                                    | Users | Teams | Roles | Automation | Key Benefits                                                             | Limitations                                                  | On-Prem | Cloud |

+| [Role Sync](../configure-authentication/saml#configure-role-sync)              | ❌    | ❌    | ✅    | Full       | Full automation of basic role assignment                                 | Limited to basic roles only                                  | ✅      | ✅    |
+| [Org Mapping](../configure-authentication/saml#configure-organization-mapping) | ❌    | ❌    | ⚠️    | Full       | Full automation of basic role assignment per organization                | Limited to basic roles only; on-premises only                | ⚠️      | ❌    |
+
+### Key advantages
+
+- **Comprehensive user and team automation**: SCIM provides full automation for user and team provisioning, while role management is handled separately through Role Sync
+- **Dynamic team creation**: Teams are created automatically based on identity provider groups
+- **Near real-time synchronization**: Changes in your identity provider are reflected based on the provider's synchronization schedule
+- **Enterprise-ready**: Designed for large organizations with complex user management needs

+
+{{< admonition type="note" >}}
+Available in [Grafana Enterprise](../../../introduction/grafana-enterprise/) and [Grafana Cloud Advanced](/docs/grafana-cloud/).
+{{< /admonition >}}
+
+SCIM streamlines identity management in Grafana by automating user lifecycle and team membership operations. This guide explains how SCIM works with existing Grafana setups, handles user provisioning, and manages team synchronization.
+
+With SCIM, you can:
+
+- **Automate user lifecycle** from creation to deactivation
+- **Manage existing users** by linking them with identity provider identities
+- **Synchronize team memberships** based on identity provider group assignments
+- **Maintain security** through automated deprovisioning
+- **Replace Team Sync** with more robust SCIM group synchronization
+
+## User provisioning with SCIM
+
+SCIM provisioning works in conjunction with existing user management methods in Grafana. While SCIM automates user provisioning from the identity provider, users can still be created through SAML just-in-time provisioning when they log in, manually through the Grafana UI, or via automation tools like Terraform and the Grafana API. For the most consistent user management experience, we recommend centralizing user provisioning through SCIM.
+
+For detailed configuration steps specific to the identity provider, see:
+
+- [Configure SCIM with Azure AD](../configure-scim-azure/)
+- [Configure SCIM with Okta](../configure-scim-okta/)
+
+### How SCIM identifies users
+
+SCIM uses a specific process to establish and maintain user identity between the identity provider and Grafana:
+
+1. Initial user lookup:
+
+   - The identity provider looks up users in Grafana using the user's login and the Unique identifier field (configurable at IdP)
+   - The identity provider expects a single result from Grafana for each user
+
+2. Identity linking:
+
+   - The identity provider learns the relationship between the found Grafana user and Grafana's internal ID
+   - The identity provider updates Grafana with the External ID
+   - Grafana updates its authentication validations to expect this External ID
+
+3. Authentication validation:
+   - Grafana expects the SAML integration to return the same External ID in SAML assertions
+   - This External ID is used to validate that the logged-in user matches the provisioned user
+
+This process ensures secure and consistent user identification across both systems, preventing security issues that could arise from email changes or other user attribute modifications.
+
+### Existing Grafana users
+
+{{< admonition type="note" >}}
+Existing users must be assigned to the Grafana app in the identity provider to maintain access once SCIM is enabled.
+{{< /admonition >}}
+
+For users who already exist in the Grafana instance:
+
+- SCIM establishes the relationship through the External ID matching process
+- Creates a secure link with the identity provider identity
+- Preserves all existing settings and access
+- Keeps the account active and unchanged until assigned in the identity provider
+
+#### Handling users from other provisioning methods
+
+To prevent conflicts and maintain consistent user management, disable or restrict other provisioning methods when implementing SCIM. This ensures that all new users are created through SCIM and prevents duplicate or conflicting user records.
+
+- SAML Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning:
+
+  - Disable `allow_sign_up` in SAML settings to prevent automatic user creation
+  - Existing JIT-provisioned users will continue to work but should be migrated to SCIM
+
+- Terraform or API provisioning:
+
+  - Stop creating new users through these methods
+  - Existing users will continue to work but should be migrated to SCIM
+  - Consider removing or archiving Terraform user creation resources
+
+- Manual user creation:
+  - Restrict UI-based user creation to administrators only
+  - Plan to migrate manually created users to SCIM
+
+### New users
+
+For users who don't yet exist in Grafana:
+
+- SCIM creates accounts when users are assigned to Grafana in the identity provider
+- Sets up initial access based on identity provider group memberships and SAML role mapping
+- No manual Grafana account creation needed
+
+### Role management
+
+SCIM handles user synchronization but not role assignments. Role management is handled through [Role Sync](../../configure-authentication/saml#configure-role-sync), and any role changes take effect during user authentication.
+
+## Team provisioning with SCIM
+
+SCIM provides automated team management capabilities that go beyond what Team Sync offers. While Team Sync only maps identity provider groups to existing Grafana teams, SCIM can automatically create and delete teams based on group changes in the identity provider.
+
+For detailed configuration steps specific to the identity provider, see:
+
+- [Configure SCIM with Azure AD](../configure-scim-azure/)
+- [Configure SCIM with Okta](../configure-scim-okta/)
+
+### SCIM vs Team Sync
+
+{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
+Do not enable both SCIM Group Sync and Team Sync simultaneously as these methods can conflict with each other.
+{{< /admonition >}}
+
+Choose one synchronization method:
+
+- If you enable SCIM, disable Team Sync and use SCIM for team management
+- If you prefer Team Sync, do not enable SCIM provisioning
+
+{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
+**Migration Considerations:** Currently, there is no official migration path or tooling available for transitioning from Team Sync to SCIM Group Sync. Attempting to migrate without proper tooling can lead to service disruption, loss of team permissions, and potential access issues. We recommend keeping your existing Team Sync setup until official migration tooling becomes available.
+{{< /admonition >}}
+
+### Key differences
+
+SCIM Group Sync provides several advantages over Team Sync:
+
+- **Automatic team creation:** SCIM automatically creates Grafana teams when new groups are added to the identity provider
+- **Automatic team deletion:** SCIM removes teams when their corresponding groups are deleted from the identity provider
+- **Real-time updates:** Team memberships are updated immediately when group assignments change
+- **Simplified management:** No need to manually create teams in Grafana before mapping them
+
+### How team synchronization works
+
+SCIM manages teams through the following process:
+
+Group assignment:
+
+- User is assigned to groups in the identity provider
+- SCIM detects group membership changes
+
+Team creation and mapping:
+
+- Creates Grafana teams for new identity provider groups
+- Maps users to appropriate teams
+- Removes users from teams when group membership changes
+
+Team membership maintenance:
+
+- Continuously syncs team memberships
+- Removes users from teams when removed from groups
+- Updates team memberships when groups change
