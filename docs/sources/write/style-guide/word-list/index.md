# Word list

In most cases, you can refer to the [word list in the Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list) to determine if you should use a word or not. The following guidelines cover cases in which:

- Grafana guidelines differ from Google guidelines.
- The word isn't included in Google guidelines.
- It's still easy to use an incorrect word because it's widely used, generally or in other Grafana media.

<!--
## A
## B
## C -->

## D

**data source** - Use this rather than _datasource_ for the noun form.

Also, use _data source plugin_ rather than _data-source plugin_.

While most compound adjectives require a hyphen, we've chosen to leave it out in this case to maintain consistency with the naming of data sources in the application and reduce confusion.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
For other compound adjectives, use a hyphen unless otherwise specified.
{{% /admonition %}}

**drop-down** - Use this rather than _dropdown_ or _drop down_.

<!--
## E
## F
## G -->

## H

**hover over** - Use this rather than _hold the pointer over_ or _point to_.

<!--
## I
## J
## K
## L
-->

## M

**menu icon** - Use this rather than _hamburger menu_ or _kebab menu_.

<!--
## N
## O
## P
## Q -->

## R

**README** - When naming a file or making a general reference to READMEs, spell using all caps. When referencing a specific README file, match the same capitalization of that file.

<!--
## S -->

## T

**time series** - Use this rather than _timeseries_ for the noun form.

When you need to use the adjective form, use _time-series_ rather than _timeseries_.

<!--

## U

## V

## W

## X
