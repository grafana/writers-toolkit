# Task title
<!-- vale Grafana.Quotes = NO -->
<!-- The task title is required. The task title succinctly describes the goal to be accomplished as the result of following the instruction. The task title contains a verb and an object. For example: "Create a dashboard". -->
<!-- vale Grafana.Quotes = YES -->

Add an introduction to the task.

<!-- The introduction is required. Add an introduction to describe what the task is and why it’s important to the user.

This section of a task topic can include conceptual material. However, limit that conceptual information to only the task at hand.

If you find yourself writing a long introduction, consider creating a concept topic, and then write a shorter form of that concept in the task introduction. Finally, link to the longer concept topic for more information.
-->

**Before you begin:**

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

<!-- The Before you begin section is optional. Use the Before you begin section to identify tasks to be completed before the current task. The links might sometimes be unrelated to the product, such as “Have this thing at hand”.

This area can also include decisions that the user should make or permissions they might need to verify they have before they begin. -->

**To [task name]:**
<!-- Add a stem sentence only when you have Before you begin items. The stem sentence introduces the steps and provides a visual cue to users who scan content that the steps are about to begin. A stem sentence begins with the word 'To' and includes the name of the task.

For example: To create a dashboard: -->

1. Step 1
1. Step 2
1. Step 3

   If you want to provide additional information about a step, add it to a separate line and indent it.

1. Step 4
<!-- Numbered steps provide a directive to the user. Steps explicitly tell the user what to do and formatted using 1. in Markdown so they get numbered automatically.

Write steps so that they contain one action, or possibly two related actions, such as Copy and paste a value. or Save and quit the program.

If a sentence does not tell the reader to do something, then it is not a step.
