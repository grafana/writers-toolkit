# Markdown guide

This Markdown guide helps keep contributions consistent across all Grafana Labs documentation. Refer to the guide and update it as needed when a subject matter expert (SME) answers a question about Markdown syntax, or a decision is made about how to apply Markdown.

We use the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the web site for the documentation.

Hugo uses a Markdown parser named Goldmark, which supports the CommonMark flavor of Markdown including some extended features. For more information, see the [CommonMark specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/), and a [quick reference guide](https://commonmark.org/help/) for CommonMark.

**Write in sentence case** throughout all technical documentation, be it long-form text or microcopy within a UI:

- This is sentence case
- This is Headline Case

## Headings

Similar to HTML headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>`), in Markdown, `#` symbols (or _hash tags_) create different heading levels:

**Example**

- \# is a parent heading.
- \#\# is a child heading.
- \#\#\# is a child’s child heading.

For the title of the page, use one `#`. For each child heading, use two `##` symbols.

### Heading don'ts

- Avoid stacked headings; do not follow a heading with another without any content between the two.
- Avoid skipping heading levels. For example, after a single `#`, use `##`, rather than `###`.
- Avoid having just one child-level heading:
  - Valid: `#`, `##`, `##`, `###`, `###`, `##`, `##`
  - Invalid: `#`, `##`, `###`, `##`, `###`, `##`
- Avoid using hyphens in headings.
- With the exception of `(Optional) `, do not include parenthesized words such as (Important).

## Bold and emphasis

- To make text **bold**, surround the text with `**two asterisks**`. For example:

  > **Note:** It is important to use GitHub-flavored Markdown emojis consistently.

- To emphasize text, surround the text with `_single underscores_`̣.
  Do not use single asterisks (`*`), because they can be easily confused with two (for bold).

```markdown
**Note:** The distributor only passes _valid_ data to the ingesters.
```

Displays as:

**Note:** The distributor only passes _valid_ data to the ingesters.

## Links and references

For information about creating links between topics inside and outside of a Grafana Labs repository, refer to [Links and cross references]({{< relref "../references" >}}).

If you want to add a link to an external website, wrap the display text in square brackets, and the web URL in curly brackets.

```markdown
[Link text to display](https://example.com)
```

**Example:** For more information about including emojis in GitHub-flavored Markdown, refer to the WebFX [Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).

## Block quotes

Include block quotes within text by using a right-angle bracket:

```markdown
> This text is in block quotes.
```

**Example:**

> Any important information about emojis
> can be separated into a blockquote.

## Code blocks

Code blocks within Markdown can highlight syntax that is specific to a language. Use three back tics to create a code block. For example, ` ``` ` immediately followed by `javascript` produces the following highlights:

```javascript
function testNum(a) {
  if (a > 0) {
    return "positive";
  } else {
    return "NOT positive";
  }
}
```

## Tables

Construct a table by separating the table headings by a `|` (pipe) character. Then, add a second line of dashes (`-`) separated by another `|` character. When constructing the table cells, separate each cell’s data with a `|`.

**Example**:

```markdown
| Heading one   | Heading two   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cell one data | Cell two data |
```

When rendered, the preceding table displays as follows:

| Heading one   | Heading two   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cell one data | Cell two data |

## Numbered lists

Use repetitive list numbering, to avoid inconsistent list numbering:

```markdown
1. First
1. Second
1. Third
```

The preceding list displays as:

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

## Unordered lists

Build a list of unordered items by using a hyphen (`-`):

```markdown
- One item
- Another item
- And another list item
```

> **Note:** Use unordered lists whenever the items have no particular sequence.

The preceding snippet displays as follows:

- One item
- Another item
- And another list item

## Images

Include images in a document using the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](link to image, starting with /static/img/docs/ if it is to an internal image "Title of image in sentence case")
```

> **Note:** Alternative text (alt text) doesn't appear when the user hovers their cursor over the image. The title text does.

**Examples:**

- `![Grafana logo](/link/to/grafanalogo/logo.png "Grafana logo")`
- `![Example](/static/img/docs/folder_name/alert_test_rule.png "Example title")`

This follows the format `![alt text](URL)`.

Alternatively, you can use the [figure shortcode]({{< relref "../shortcodes#figure-shortcode" >}}) if you need more image options, such as adding captions or controlling the image size.

Within Markdown, HTML is valid, but should be used sparingly:

```html
<img
  src="example.png"
  alt="Example image"
  style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;"
/>
```

In most cases, use Markdown syntax rather than HTML syntax. Only use HTML if you need to change the image in ways that Markdown does not support.

## Description list

The Markdown parser that Hugo uses, Goldmark, has built-in support for description lists.
You can use description lists for terms and their definitions, or core concepts.
The syntax is as follows:

```markdown
term
: description_text
```

You can add more markup in a description list.
For example, you can format the definition terms as bold text.

```markdown
Reasons you might want to write programs in Go include the following:

**Fast compile times**
: The Go compiler is fast!

**Ecosystem**
: Go tooling is excellent.
```

The preceding description list displays as follows:

**Fast compile times**
: The Go compiler is fast!

**Ecosystem**
: Go tooling is excellent.

## Comments

You can include comments that do not display in published output:

`[comment]: <> (Comment text to display)`

## Shortcodes

Shortcodes are predefined templates that let you reuse snippets of technical documentation. To learn how to use shortcodes, refer to [Shortcodes]({{< relref "../shortcodes" >}}).
