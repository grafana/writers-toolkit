# Complete the tutorial

<!-- The topic title is required. The topic title succinctly describes the goal to accomplish, as the result of following the instructions. The tutorial title contains a verb and an object. For example: Provision dashboards and data sources -->

Add an overview and optional background details to the tutorial.

<!-- The overview is required. Add an overview to describe what the goal is and why itâ€™s important to the user. You can also add background information -- in what context would it be used?

This section of a tutorial topic can include conceptual material. However, limit conceptual information to only the tasks at hand.

If you write a long overview, consider creating a concept topic. Then, write a shorter form of that concept in the tutorial overview, and link to the longer concept topic for more information.

## Before you begin

- _System requirement_
- Software version _n_ is installed
- Valid _software_ license

<!-- This section is optional. Use it to identify any prerequisite conditions (such as a specific version, license, or system requirement), permissions, any necessary decision, or tasks to complete before proceeding. Sometimes you might want to include a tip, such as **Tip:** Run the commands within a screen session.

Replace any text in _italics_ with content for your procedure and remove or add lines as needed.

Write each prerequisite as a full sentence or sentence fragment, using parallel structures.

If you have more than one task in your tutorial, include all prerequisites in this section. For example, if you have a page that configures a widget and several tasks have prerequisites, list all prerequisites in the Before you begin section. This way users can have everything they need before they start performing the tasks.

If you do not need this section, delete it.
 -->

## Perform task

<!-- Optional: Add an introductory sentence to this task. For example, summarize the purpose of this task in relation to the overall procedure.    -->

To [task name]:

<!--
The stem sentence introduces the steps and provides a visual cue for users who scan content, and it lets them know that the steps are about to begin.

A stem sentence begins with the word 'To' and includes the name of the task.
If you want to provide additional information about a step, add it to a separate line and indent it.

For example:

To build a dashboard: -->

1. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/.

   The default HTTP port that Grafana listens to is `3000` unless you have configured a different port.

1. On the sign-in page, enter `admin` for the username and password.
1. Click **Sign in**.

   If successful, you will see a prompt to change the password.

1. Check the current context for your Kubernetes cluster and make sure that it is correct:

   ```bash
   kubectl config current-context
   ```

1. ...
<!-- Numbered steps provide a directive to the user; they tell the user explicitly what to do. Format steps using 1. in Markdown so they get numbered automatically.

Write steps so that they contain one action, or possibly two related actions, such as _Copy and paste a value._ or _Save and quit the program._

If a sentence does not tell the reader to do something, then it is not a step.

To add context that is directly related to a step, or to add a code block, indent it underneath the step. Doing so properly scopes the added information to the step.
-->

## Perform another task

<!-- This section provides an example of nested steps with code blocks. -->

1.  Create a file named `sample.yaml` and copy the following YAML configuration into it:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
    ```

1.  Run the following command to apply the `sample.yaml` file:

        ```bash
        kubectl apply --namespace sample -f sample.yaml
        ```

1.  To check that MinIO is correctly configured, sign in and verify that a bucket has been created:

    1. Port-forward the service to port 9001:
       ```bash
        kubectl port-forward --namespace tempo service/sample 9001:9001
       ```
    1. Navigate to the admin bash using your browser: `https://localhost:9001`. The sign-in credentials are username `user` and password `user123`.
    1. Verify that the Buckets page lists `sample-data`.

    Without these buckets, no data will be stored.

## Optional: Perform an optional task

<!-- Optional: If a task is not required but provides additional features, you can mark that section as optional and describe when it should be completed. If this section is not needed, delete it.
-->

## Summary

 <!-- 
 Optional: Use this section if you have more than one task that was performed. Otherwise, delete this section.

To summarize:
