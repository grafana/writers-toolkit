# Topic types

Grafana Labs documentation is made up of different topic types: _concept_, _task_, and _reference_. We encourage you to use these topic types when you write content.

Depending on the needs of a particular product area, select a topic type from the following table to learn about each.

Type | Description 
---| --- 
[Concept]({{< relref "concept/" >}})| Provides an overview and background information. Answers the question "What is it?
[Task]({{< relref "task/" >}})| Provides numbered steps that describe how to achieve an outcome. Answers the question "How do I?".
[Reference]({{< relref "reference/" >}}) | Provides users with the information they might need to refer to during a task. Answers the question "What details do I need to accomplish this task?". 

For your convenience, we have created topic [templates](https://github.com/grafana/writers-toolkit/tree/main/docs/static/templates).
