# Writersâ€™ Toolkit

Welcome! 

We're glad you're here to help make our technical documentation even better. We develop content that leads our users to success using Grafana products. Technical accuracy is our primary consideration, and we value the use of inclusive language. We regard your feedback as a gift - thanks for reading through these guidelines.

## Intended audience
We write these guidelines for contributors who are interested in improving our technical content.

## Ways to contribute
We're thrilled that you are considering contributing to these writing guidelines. You can contribute content in the following ways:

- Request a change
- Edit a topic
- Write a topic

## Understanding the PR review and approval workflow
When you add a PR to the repo with a label associated with `type/docs`, it will be reviewed by a member of the technical writing team. Depending on the size of the PR and the priority of other work, the PR will either be immediately reviewed and merged (minor fixes typically follow this pattern) or the PR will be triaged and placed in the backlog of work or moved into further development.

Thank you for reading these guidelines and contributing to Grafana Labs technical documentation!
