# Voice and tone guidelines

<!-- vale Grafana.We = NO -->
<!-- This page talks about the voice and tone of our organization. -->

At Grafana, we like our company to sound like a real person.

Voice and tone reflect your attitude and how you convey information.
Word choice, use of **bold** or _italic_ emphasis, punctuation, and grammar all affect your voice.
The tone you choose reflects the urgency of your message and can therefore change depending on the situation.

Consult the following voice and tone guidelines when you write technical documentation.

## Project confidence

You know the subject matter better than anyone.
Let your style reflect your expertise.
Write in an authoritative tone to evoke confidence in your reader.

## Be conversational

<!-- vale Grafana.Simple = NO -->

Write in a natural and conversational style with language that reflects a positive and friendly tone.
Be informative and helpful by using easy-to-understand words and sentences.
Keep your language simple and straightforward.

<!-- vale Grafana.Simple = YES -->

## Tone

A casual tone is accepted in UI copy and supporting material compared to traditional business writing.

As long as they allow for shorter sentences, you can use the words _and_, _but_, and _so_ in moderation.

Use contractions like _isn't_ for _is not_ to help to convey an informal tone.

## Task completion

Provide the user with just enough information to complete a task.
Inform the user that something has happened as expected once the task is completed.

In headings for tasks, use a verb that clearly describes the action completed by the task.
Avoid using gerunds in headings.
For example, use "Configure metrics-generator" as a heading instead of "Configuring metrics-generator".

Refer to [Headings and titles](https://developers.google.com/style/headings) in the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/) for more information.

## Learning

There are times when it's helpful to explain or educate users more.
It's important to Grafana Labs that users feel confident about their actions and Grafana Labs' product capabilities.

Don't just teach people how to perform an action, but also why they should.

## Motivation

<!-- vale Grafana.GoogleWill = NO -->
<!-- This is talking about the future next steps -->

Motivate the user to continue by providing information about the next steps.
Don't assume the user knows what the next steps are or what the outcome will be.
